# Gradient-Color
I needed to add a gradient to the text, but I didn't want to do it manually. Therefore, I decided to write a program that will do it for me, at first I tried it in Python, but I don't know this language very well, so I chose Lua. As a result, I managed to make a small program that replaced the beginning and end of a line with a special tag.

## Tasks
- [x] Add color picker for gradient
- [x] Add hex color picker support
- [ ] Fix annoying bugs
