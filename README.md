# Gradient-Color
I needed to add a gradient to the text, but I didn't want to do it manually. Therefore, I decided to write a program that will do it for me, at first I tried it in Python, but I don't know this language very well, so I chose Lua. As a result, I managed to make a small program that replaced the beginning and end of a line with a special tag.

At the moment, the program may not work well in some places, which is why sometimes you have to edit the text manually, but it does most of the work well.

## Tasks
- [x] Add color picker for gradient
- [x] Add hex color picker support
- [ ] Fix annoying bugs
